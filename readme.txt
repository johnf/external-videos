This is a WordPress post types plugin for videos posted to external social networking sites.

== Description ==

This plugin creates a new WordPress post type called "External Videos" and aggregates videos from a external social networking site's user channel to the WordPress instance. For example, it finds all the videos of the user "Fred" on YouTube and adds them each as a new post type.

While some aspects of this plugin do work on wordpress 2.9.2 it is
really designed for 3.0+. When using 2.9 you will miss the following
features:

* Admin Interface to list videos
* Video page per video
* Adding videos as attachments to posts


== Installation ==

To install the External Videos plugin simply:

1. Unpack the downloaded zipped file
2. Upload the "external-videos" folder to your /wp-content/plugins directory
3. Log into Wordpress
4. Go to the "Plugins" page
5. Activate the Automatic YouTube Video Posts Plugin
